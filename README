This project was made for the course Social Netowrk Analysis at the University of Oulu, Finland. The dataset given was made of information about every country in smoking habits and laws about it.

The goal was to draw different relations in each exercise, all of them about the nordic countries and how they relate to each other.

In the end, conclusions were taken.
